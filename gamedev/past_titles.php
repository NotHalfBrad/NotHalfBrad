I've been encountering increasing interest in finding information about my lost mobile titles, that are no longer purchasable. I'm planning to post as much information and resources from those games as possible. Something akin to a postmortem++. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo5sy47bWjQ&lc=z22tfbej2obkufx1pacdp43as2sexkp030vt0ibkcpxw03c010c.1558939058055884">THIS</a> video.

 Ratchet gathers a lot of interest on the internet, but there are still playable .jar files around. Specifically, I hope to first cast some light on Spider-man 2, Ghostbusters, and Zorro... if not find some playable versions that have been squirreled away somewhere.
<p>
	Coming soon...
